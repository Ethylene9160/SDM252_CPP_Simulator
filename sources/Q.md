# Basic Concept Statement on CPP

In this term, you're supposted to explain each concept provide. 10 problems are provided, with 2 points each.(Total: 20 score)



## 1 Explain basic principle when initialize a data object.





#  Simple Coding

In this quotes, giving 10 problems(2 pit each), fix the code block.

## 1 Swap by Pointers

Impliment a function below, to swap the values of the space the pointers pointing.

```c++
void swap(int *a, int *b){
    //Write down your code.
    
}
```

## 2 Print an Array

An array (int type), with

```c++
void printArary(int*array, int size){
    for(uint32_t i=0; i < size; ++i){
        //write down your code.
        
    }
}
```



## 3 Fix a Distructor

When the instance `MyClass` is to be distroied, we need to delete all the instances in the class. Fix the distructor in this example.

```c++
struct Point{
  	int x;
    int y;
    Point():x(0),y(0){}
};
class MyClass{
	Point*p;
    MyClass(){
        this->p = new Point();
    }
    ~Node(){
        //Write down your code.
        
    } 
};
```





# Realistic Problem

Given 2 problems realistic, you're supposed to get correct codes.
